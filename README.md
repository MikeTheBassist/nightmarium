# Nightmarium
Nightmarium is a web game I made as a final project for a Javascript/JQuery class I took while pursuing a degree in application development.
I plan on adding several features and refining the gameplay before launching it as an official project of mine, but in the meantime
I thought I would put the code-base up here to showcase the work I've done so far.


### Prerequisites

No pre-reqs, it's a simple browser-based game built off of JavaScript.

### Getting Started

Download all project files, open Nightmarium.html in an acceptable browser.

## Built With

* [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com) - I used the skeleton framework to make the display site for the game.
* [JQuery](https://www.jquery.com/) - JQuery is used for many of the controls and some object manipulation

## Authors

* **Michael Langley** - *Initial work* - [MikeTheBassist](https://github.com/MikeTheBassist)

## License

This project is currently unlicensed and is not open source yet.  I plan on developing the engine to a point where it can be used as a
template for web-based top-down games but I haven't gotten that far yet.

## Acknowledgments

* Thanks to Wendy, Noah and Olga for the help given during the beginning of this project.
